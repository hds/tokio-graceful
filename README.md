Shutdown management for graceful shutdown of [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) applications.
Guard creating and usage is lock-free and the crate only locks when:

- the shutdwn signal was not yet given and you wait with a (weak or strong) guard
  on whether or not it was in fact canelled;
- the check of whether or not the app can shuts down typically is locked until
  the shutdown signal was received and all (strong) guards were dropped.

This crate is written in 100% safe Rust code.

## Examples

One example to show it all:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use tokio_graceful::Shutdown;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // most users can just use `Shutdown::default()` to initiate
    // shutdown upon either Sigterm or CTRL+C (Sigkill).
    let signal = tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
    let shutdown = Shutdown::new(signal);

    // you can use shutdown to spawn tasks that will
    // include a guard to prevent the shutdown from completing
    // aslong as these tasks are open
    shutdown.spawn_task(async {
        tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(10)).await;
    });
    // or spawn a function such that you have access to the guard coupled to the task
    shutdown.spawn_task_fn(|guard| async move {
        let guard2 = guard.clone();
        guard.cancelled().await;
    });

    // this guard isn't dropped, but as it's a weak guard
    // it has no impact on the ref count of the common tokens.
    let guard_weak = shutdown.guard_weak();

    // this guard needs to be dropped as otherwise the shutdown is prevented;
    let guard = shutdown.guard();
    drop(guard);

    // guards can be downgraded to weak guards, to not have it be counted any longer in the ref count
    let weak_guard_2 = shutdown.guard().downgrade();

    // guards (weak or not) are cancel safe
    tokio::select! {
        _ = tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(10)) => {},
        _ = weak_guard_2.into_cancelled() => {},
    }

    // you can also wait to shut down without any timeout limit
    // `shutdown.shutdown().await;`
    shutdown
        .shutdown_with_limit(Duration::from_secs(60))
        .await
        .unwrap();

    // once a shutdown is triggered the ::cancelled() fn will immediately return true,
    // forever, not just once. Even after shutdown process is completely finished.
    guard_weak.cancelled().await;

    // weak guards can be upgraded to regular guards to take into account for ref count
    let guard = guard_weak.upgrade();
    // even this one however will know it was cancelled
    guard.cancelled().await;
}

```

### Runnable Examples

While the above example shows pretty much all parts of this crate at once,
it might be useful to see examples on how this crate is to be used in
an actual production-like setting. That's what these runnable examples are for.

The runnable examples are best run with `RUST_LOG=trace` environment variable set,
such that you see the verbose logs of `tokio-graceful` and really see it in action
and get a sense on how it works, or at least its flow is.

> [examples/tokio_tcp.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/tokio-graceful/tree/main/examples/tokio_tcp.rs)
>
> ```bash
> RUST_LOG=trace cargo run --example tokio_tcp
> ```

The `tokio_tcp` example showcases the original use case of why `tokio-graceful` shutdown was developed,
as it makes managing graceful shutdown from start to finish a lot easier, without immediately grabbing
to big power tools or providing more then is needed.

The example runs a tcp 'echo' server which you can best play with using
telnet: `telnet 127.0.0.1 8080`. As you are in control of when to exit you can easily let it timeout if you wish.

> [examples/hyper.rs](https://github.com/plabayo/tokio-graceful/tree/main/examples/hyper.rs)
>
> ```bash
> RUST_LOG=trace cargo run --example hyper
> ```

In case you wish to use this library as a [Hyper](https://hyper.rs/) user
you can do so using pretty much the same approach as
the Tokio tcp example.

This example only has one router server function which returns 'hello' (200 OK) after 5s.
The delay is there to allow you to see the graceful shutdown in action.

## Contributing

:balloon: Thanks for your help improving the project! We are so happy to have
you! We have a [contributing guide][contributing] to help you get involved in the
`tokio-graceful` project.

### Shoutouts

Special shoutout for this library goes to [the Tokio ecosystem](https://tokio.rs/).
Those who developed it as well as the folks hanging on the [Tokio discord server](https://discord.gg/tokio).
The discussions and Q&A sessions with them were very crucial to the development of this project.
Tokio's codebase is also a gem of examples on what is possible and what are good practices.

In this context also an extra shoutout to [@tobz](https://github.com/tobz) who
gave me the idea of approaching it from an Atomic perspective instead
of immediately going for channel solutions.
